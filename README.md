# Anycubic Chiron Klipper

This repo contains my configurations for my mostly stock Anycubic Chiron. Feel free to take this configuration and adapt it for your printer.

## Printer Modifications

The printer is a bone-stock Chiron with TMC 2208 drivers on X, Y, and Z stepper motors and an upgraded Bondtech BMG extruder.

I did not reverse the wires in my physical plug when installing the TMC drivers, so the directional pins for X, Y, and Z are the inverse of a stock printer. The Bondtech BMG extruder is a dual gear design and will likely require anyone using this profile to recalibrate their extruder's rotation_distance to properly extrude the correct amount of filament.
